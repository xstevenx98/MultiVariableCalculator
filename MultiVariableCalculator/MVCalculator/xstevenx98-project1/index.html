        <h1>Project One: Multibase Calculator</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>The main objective of this project is to give you experience with the Swing API, especially event handling.</p>

	<p>As with Project 0, you must use this repository to share your code with me. If you haven't already, clone this repository to your Eclipse workspace. There is no Java code in this repository initially; use your <code>
            Base4Calculator</code> project as the basis for this project. One easy way to do that in Eclipse: open your <code>
            Base4Calculator
          </code>
          project, which should be "connected" to the <code>
            class16-code
          </code>
          clone you made in class. Right-click on the project, go to the Team menu, and select "Disconnect" (probably near the bottom). This will take your project out of git version control. Now, "reconnect" it to this repository with the "Share Project" option from the Team menu. Now all your commits and pushes will be reflected in this repository.
          
        </p>

        <p>The project is due at 11:59pm on Wednesday, May 3. I will
        clone your repositories for grading at that time.</p>

        <h2>The Project</h2>

    <p>In class, you started working on a base 4 calculator. In this project, you will expand the functionality of this calculator to work with any base between 2 and 16.</p>

    <p>Specifically, you will need 16 "digit buttons" for the digits
        0...9 and A...F (remember that "letter digits" are used to
        represent digits whose values are 10 or greater, as
        in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a>,
        or base 16). And you will need a <code><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JSlider.html">JSlider</a></code> that lets the user select the base the calculator is
        currently using. You should also be sure the calculator
        displays its current base in a useful way. When the user uses
        the slider to select a different base, the calculator should
      <em>respond immediately</em>: The number in the calculator's display
        area should be represented in the new base, and the digit
      buttons should reflect the new base. You can do
        this <em>very</em> responsively, as the user is moving the
        "knob," or you can wait until the user is done. It should be clear to the user that the "active" buttons depend on the base: the buttons may be enabled/disabled (using the <code>
        setEnabled()</code> method), or you could try something more complex. 
    </p>

    <p>In addition to the multibase functionality, your calculator should:
    <ul>
    <li>Calculate correctly (again, using integer division, not decimals)</li>
    <li>Have a reasonable layout</li>
    <li>Have well-designed code.</li>
    <li>Be completely documented, as in project 0: <code>README.md</code>, doccomments, javadoc, inline comments.</li>
    </ul></p>

        
        <h2>Grading</h2>

        <p>I will grade out of 100 points, allocated as follows:</p>

        <ol>
            
                  <li><p><b>40% Correctness and Efficiency</b>. Does the calculator compute and display correctly, with all UI components behaving correctly? Is your layout complete and usable? Is your code efficient in its use of time and storage space?

                </p></li>
           
            
                <li><p><b>20% Documentation</b>. Your project should include
                three kinds of documentation, as described in the <a
                    href="http://bc-cisc3120-s17.github.io/documentation.html">About
                    Documentation</a> page. You should provide doccomments
                for each class and method in your project, and generate
                HTML documentation using javadoc. For this project, the
                <code>README.md</code> file in your repository
                needs only to contain a "Works Cited" section: Any
                website, book, or similar resource from which you get
                useful guidance must be listed here, along with a brief
                description of what you got from it (a bit of code? an
                explanation? an answer to a question?). You do not need
                to list the Java API or either of the two books
                required/recommended for class. If you use no other
                resources, then your "Works Cited" section must simply
                contain the word <em>None</em>.<p></li>
            

            <li><p>
                    <b>20% Design</b>. Are the relationships among your classes (and the way they interact with the Java library classes) logical, clear, and robust? Do they (for example) adhere to the IS-A and HAS-A rules? Do they make appropriate use of design patterns? Is your code otherwise well-designed, e.g. avoiding duplicate code?
              </p>
            </li>

                    <li><p><b>20% Style</b>. As before, your code should be properly
        formatted, with enough (but not too much) whitespace. Eclipse
        will do most of this for you; make sure you let it help you.
        Variable names, metohd names, etc, should all be
        "self-documenting" but not excessively long (one-letter
        variables names should <em>only</em> be used as loop counters).
        <em>Generally</em>, you can use any style you like, as long as
        you're consistent. If you're not sure what style to use, follow
        the <a
            href="https://github.com/twitter/commons/blob/master/src/java/com/twitter/common/styleguide.md">GitHub 
            Style Guide</a>, except where Eclipse's automatic formatting
        contradicts these guidelines.</p>
                      </li>
        </ol>

                  <p><b>Extra Credit</b>. You can earn up to 10
                  points of extra credit by implementing additional
                  calculator-ish functions. For example: memory, or a
                  "paper tape" that shows a history of the
                  calculations (maybe that should be exportable to a
                  file?). If you have other ideas, please check with
                  me about their extra-creditability before you dive
                    in. (Increasing the "base range" will <em>not</em> earn extra credit. Keep it 2&ndash;16.) Any extra behaviors you provide should be
            listed briefly in the
            <code>README.md</code></p>

                  
 <p>
            On this project, and probably all projects this semester,  you are to work strictly
            <em>on your own</em>. Specifically, you may neither show
            your code to, nor look at the code of, anyone else taking
            3120 this semester. You may consult online/textbook
            resources (subject to the "Documentation" requirements
            above). You may certainly consult with me. You may, if you
            like, discuss your design at a high level with other
            students ("Oh, I found the
            <code>java.foo.bar</code>
            package to be really helpful," or, "Sure, I can explain the
            geometry of a paint window to you.").</p>

 <h2>Hints</h2>

 <p>Notice that you'll have a fair number of  "digit buttons" that you'll be treating
 essentially the same way. This is an excellent opportunity to
 experiment using an array, <code>ArrayList</code>, or some other
 kind of collection, to manage this clot of buttons. Perhaps look around in the Java API to see if
 there are any classes that will make it easier to deal with this
   bunch of buttons.</p>

                  <p>Again, it's probably best to make sure
                  everything else works before you start tweaking
                  your layout. Remember that complex layouts can be
                    handled by <em>nesting</em>&mdash;for example,
                  study the BeatBox layout code that starts on p.
                  420. (It seriously starts on that page.)</p>
